# prime
Explanation:
This code implements a program to check if a given number is prime. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The is_prime function takes a parameter number and performs the following steps:

If the number is less than or equal to 1, it returns False since prime numbers must be greater than 1.
It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive) using a for loop.
For each iteration, it checks if the number is divisible by the current value of i. If it is, the number is not prime, and False is returned.
If no divisors are found, the number is prime, and True is returned.
In the main part of the code, the user is prompted to enter a number. The input is stored in the variable num. The is_prime function is then called with num as an argument to check if it is prime. Based on the returned value, the program prints either "<num> is a prime number." or "<num> is not a prime number."

Please note that this code assumes the input is a positive integer. Additional input validation and error handling may be necessary to handle other types of inputs or handle edge cases.
